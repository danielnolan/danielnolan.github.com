description: Derek get's my take on what it was like to take over a Thoughtbot project.

---
In 2014 I landed a remote gig with a Boston based company called the T1D Exchange.
Hired as the lead developer on their myglu web app, I was extremely stoked when
I found out the MVP for the project I was taking over was built by Thougtbot in Boston! 
I had the please of catching up two of the original Thoughtbot Devs 
Derek Prior and Sean Griffin at Rails Conf in Atlanta.
We chatted for a bit, they both agreed it was one of their favorite projects.
They decided to follow Sandi Metz's rules to a t on this project.
After taking over the project my boss insisted that I follow the conventions
that were set forth on the project. I have never worked in a cleaner,
more well thought out Rails codebase, ever. Here is a link to the interview.
