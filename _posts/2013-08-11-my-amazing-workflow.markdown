description: Post about my amazing workflow
---

Just wanted to write a quick post about my workflow.
I have been using Tmux, iTerm2, and Vim for a good while now and I love it.
Since switching from writing PHP to writing Ruby full time, I have been
working on upgrading my tools so they are better suited for Ruby and for working on multiple projects.
Tmux is great for multiple projects cause you can setup different sessions for working on different projects.
You can attach and detach from these sessions quickly which makes switching between projects on
the fly a breeze. Enter [Tmuxinator](https://github.com/aziz/tmuxinator). Tmuxinator makes setting up
complex tmux sessions a snap. Tmuxinator allows you to have a yaml configuration file for each project.
Once you have your configuration file setup you can just run mux project-name start and it will setup your
Tmux session as for you based on your configuration file. When I have some more time I will post about
actually setting up and configuring Tmuxinator.
