In a [previous post] I talked about how I was deploying my blog to Github Pages
with Travis CI. Since Github Actions is free for open source projects
I'm able to use it to deploy [my blog].
I use the [deploy pages Github Action] and their [starter workflow for Jekyll]
with the addition of [html-proofer] that runs on the HTML generated by Jekyll.
Add a new post to _posts, commit it to main, git push and GH actions will build my site with Jekyll,
run the generated HTML through [html-proofer], and deploy it to Github Pages.
Here's [my actions workflow].
