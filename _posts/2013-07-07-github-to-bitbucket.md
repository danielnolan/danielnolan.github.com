description: Post about switching from Github to Bitbucket for hosting my private git repos
---

I recently started with a new company writing Ruby.
The company I work for now uses Bitbucket because they allow unlimited private repos.
This makes absolute sense for my personal projects. I have all kinds of projects 
I don&#39;t want to share with the public that I would love to have backed up to a remote git host.
Bitbucket allowing 5 users for free and unlimited repos had me sold. I moved all
of my private repos over to Bitbucket and downgraded my Github account to a free
account. I mean Github is a great service but paying for private repos for projects
I have not worked on in forever just doesn&#39;t make sense to me.
