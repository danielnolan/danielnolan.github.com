description: Post about switching from Github to Bitbucket for hosting my private git repos
---

I recently switched jobs from writing PHP to writing Ruby.
The shop I work for now uses Bitbucket because they allow unlimited private repos.
This makes absolute sense for me. I have all kinds of projects I don't want to share
with the public that I would love to have backed up to a remote git host.
Bitbucket allowing 5 users for free and unlimited repos had me sold. Moved all
of my private repos over to Bitbucket and downgraded my Github account to a free
account. I mean Github is a great service but paying for private repos for projects
I have not worked on in forever just doesn't make sense to me.
