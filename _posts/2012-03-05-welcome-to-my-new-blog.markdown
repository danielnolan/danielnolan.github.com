So I finally got around to finishing my new site. It has been way too long since I have been writing so I have a lot to write about. I will be doing some screencasts also. My day job has me doing a lot of Cake PHP, Sencha EXTJS, and some really cool hardware intergration stuff. At night I have been focused on mobile web and Ruby/Ruby on Rails development. Most of my posts will be related to development, but I will probably include some posts about cars and beers too.
