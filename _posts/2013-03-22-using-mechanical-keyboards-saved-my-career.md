description: Post about mechanical keyboards and how they saved my career
---

I work full time for a company during the day writing PHP.
At night I am usually hacking on something in Ruby.
As most of you know spending so much time on the computer is bad for you.
We got Macbook Pros at my day job last year, within months of using the flat keybord
day and night my hands and wrists hurt so bad I thought my career was going to be over.
After trying many things including wrist braces, wrist rests, and exercises I read somewhere about
mechanical switch keyboards and how much better they are for typing for long periods
of time. I ordered one from NewEgg and started using it for all my typing. That combined 
with some wrist and hand exercises and here I am a year later still programming 16 or 17
hours a day sometimes with no pain what so ever. Everyone is like how can you spend $100+
dollars on a keyboard? I say when it comes to your health and career longevity, $100 is
not even a concern. I now use a Mitas keyboard at home and a CoolerMaster at work. I will never
use a cheap or flat key keyboard ever again.
